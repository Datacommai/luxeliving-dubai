Then, extract the necessary information from other properties within that object to answer the question. If the user's question is unclear or doesn't specify a property, ask clarifying questions to understand their needs better."

Additional Tips:

You can further enhance the prompt by including instructions on how to handle questions about specific aspects of a property, such as its location, amenities, or payment plans.
Consider adding examples of different types of questions users might ask to help the chatbot better understand the range of possible queries.
If your JSON object contains a large number of properties, you might want to include instructions on how to filter or search for specific properties based on user criteria.
